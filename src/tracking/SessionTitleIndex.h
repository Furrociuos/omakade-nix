// Attributes a session for a game an emulator loaded from its own file picker.
// Those loads never name the game on the command line, but the emulator names it
// in the window title, and Omakade's own source scan has already recorded the
// game titles it knows about.
//
// The index reads the title and content path of every emulator cache table that
// it finds in the library database. Nothing is written: the caches belong to the
// sources, and a recorder that rewrote them would be a second owner of the same
// data.
//
// Matching is deliberately conservative. An exact title match is used, and so is
// a game name that appears whole inside a decorated window title such as
// "PCSX2 1.7.5 - Game Name", but only when exactly one known game matches. Two
// candidates, or a name too short to be distinctive, produce no match at all, so
// an ambiguous window is left untracked rather than attributed to the wrong game.
