// Emulator launch profiles drive session attribution. A profile names the
// binaries an emulator runs under; the matcher then looks for a command line
// argument that looks like a game image. That covers every launch path that
// names the game on the command line: Omakade launches, terminal launches, and
// wrapper scripts. Loading a game from inside the emulator's own file picker
// shows no path on the command line, so two weaker kinds of evidence are
// consulted for those, in this order:
//
//  1. an attribution adapter, which reads a record the emulator rewrites while
//     the game runs (see tracking/AttributionAdapter.h). Session-verified.
//  2. the window title, matched against the titles the sources already know.
//     Weak: a title is decoration, and it is not evidence that the game is
//     loaded rather than merely named on screen.
//
// A process that names its own game on the command line is never asked about
// again, so weak evidence cannot overwrite strong evidence.
